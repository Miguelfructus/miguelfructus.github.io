	<p><strong>The Internet Security</strong> is a branch of computer security which comprises various security measures exercised for ensuring the security of transactions done online. In the process, the internet security prevents attacks targeted at browsers, network, operating systems, and other applications. Today, businesses and governments are more concerned about safeguarding from Cyber attacks and malware programs that originate from the internet. The main aim of Internet security is to set up precise rules and regulations that can deflect attacks that arise from the Internet.  </p>
	<p>Internet security relies on particular resources and criteria for safeguarding the data that is communicated or transferred online. The safeguarding techniques include different kinds of encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). Besides, the other features of a secure Web setup can include firewalls that prevent undesired traffic, and anti-spyware, anti-malware, and anti-virus programs that work from particular networks or devices to watch online traffic for malicious attachments.</p>
