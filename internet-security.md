	<head><h2><u><strong> ¿What is The Internet Security?</strong></u></h2></head>
	<p><strong>The Internet Security</strong> is a branch of computer security which comprises various security measures exercised for ensuring the security of transactions done online. In the process, the internet security prevents attacks targeted at browsers, network, operating systems, and other applications. Today, businesses and governments are more concerned about safeguarding from Cyber attacks and malware programs that originate from the internet. The main aim of Internet security is to set up precise rules and regulations that can deflect attacks that arise from the Internet.  </p>
	<p>Internet security relies on particular resources and criteria for safeguarding the data that is communicated or transferred online. The safeguarding techniques include different kinds of encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). Besides, the other features of a secure Web setup can include firewalls that prevent undesired traffic, and anti-spyware, anti-malware, and anti-virus programs that work from particular networks or devices to watch online traffic for malicious attachments.</p>

	<head><u>Active Attacks:</u></head>
	<p>Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.</p>

	<head><u>Passive Attacks:</u></head>
	<p>Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack.</p>

	  <head><h2><u><strong>¿What is Malware?</head></h2></u></strong>
	<h4 id="Malware">Malware</h4>
	<p>Short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. As Microsoft puts it malware, is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network. In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it</p>
	<head><h3><u>Types Of Malware</head></h3></u>
	<p>There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads. You've probably heard the words<strong> virus, worm and trojan </strong> used interchangeably, but as Symantec explains, they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:</p>
	<p>A <strong>virus</strong> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.</p>
	<p>A <strong>worm</strong> is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.</p>
    <p>A <strong>trojan</strong> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.</p>
    <p> But also we can see another types what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:</p>
	<p>A <strong>spyware</strong> is defined by Webroot Cybersecurity as "malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A keylogger is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes—great for stealing passwords.</p>
	<p>And also other types such as a Rootkit, an Adware, a Ransomware, a Cryptojacking or a Malvertising.</p>

	<head><h2><u><strong>¿What is Hardware?</head></h2></u></strong>
	<p><strong>Hardware</strong> is a physical component of a computer system containing a circuit board, ICs, or other electronics. A perfect example of hardware is the screen on which you are viewing this page. Whether it be a monitor, tablet, or smartphone, it is hardware.</p>
	<p>Without any hardware, your computer would not exist, and software could not be used.</p>
	<head><h2><u><strong>¿What is Software?</head></h2></u></strong>
	<p><strong>Software,</strong> instructions that tell a computer what to do. Software comprises the entire set of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of a computer system. The term was coined to differentiate these instructions from hardware,the physical components of a computer system. A set of instructions that directs a computer’s hardware to perform a task is called a program, or software program. 
	<p>The two main types of software are system software and application software.</p>

        <h3 id="Networks Protocols">Networks Protocols</h3>
	<head><h2><u><strong>¿What are Networks Protocols?</head></h2></u></strong>
	<p>A <strong>Network Protocol</strong> is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.</p>
	<p>There are some types of network portocols:</p>
	<head><u><strong>SSL</head></u></strong>
	<p><strong>SSL</strong> stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details. The two systems can be a server and a client (for example, a shopping website and browser) or server to server (for example, an application with personal identifiable information or with payroll information).</p>
	<p>It does this by making sure that any data transferred between users and sites, or between two systems remain impossible to read. It uses encryption algorithms to scramble data in transit, preventing hackers from reading it as it is sent over the connection. This information could be anything sensitive or personal which can include credit card numbers and other financial information, names and addresses.</p>
