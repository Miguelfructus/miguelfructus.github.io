    <h1>Digital Signature</h1>
    <head><h2><u><strong> ¿What is Digital Signature?</strong></u></h2></head>
    <p>A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very strong reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).</p>
    <p>Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.</p>
    <p>Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, which includes any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature,but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures.
    <p>Digital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography. In many instances they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. Digital signatures can also provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret</p>
    
    <head><h3><u><strong> ¿What are the steps to do to sign a document with your DNI?</strong></u></h3></head>
    <ol>
    <li>Take an electronic ID scanner </li>
      <img src="https://firmarpdf.com/wp-content/uploads/Dnie_electronico_Amazon-300x290.jpg">
    <li>Install Dnie reader: If your operating system is Windows with versions W7, W8, W8.1 and Windows 10, you will only have to insert the DNIe card in the cryptographic reader and the Operating System will install the DNIe driver automatically.</li>
      <img src="https://firmarpdf.com/wp-content/uploads/instalacion_driver_dnie_2.jpg">
    <li>Install the necessary software on your computer to be able to interact properly with the cryptographic cards and with the DNI 3.0. Your computer will need to have installed "pieces" of software called cryptographic modules: </li>
    <li>Check that the browser detects your electronic ID. </li>
    <li>Open the PDF document to digitally sign it with your dnie </li>
    <li>Click on "tools" at the top and then on the "Certificates" icon </li>
      <img src="https://firmarpdf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-Certificados-pdf.jpg">
    <li>Click on "Digital Signature" in the certificates menu at the top </li>
      <img src="https://firmarpdf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Firmar-digitalmente-pdf.jpg">
    <li>Drag the box of your signature in the place where you want to sign and then your electronic ID should appear in the list of certificates, select it and click on the button «continue» and «sign». It will ask you for the PIN, you add it and that's it. </li>
    <li>Save the document with a new name or replace the current document. Your signature will have been embedded with your electronic ID data, with the current date and time. </li>
