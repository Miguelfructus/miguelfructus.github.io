	<head><h2><u><strong>¿What are Accesibility Standars?</head></h2></u></strong>
	<p><strong>Accesibility Standars</strong> are a subtopic of the main topic that is <strong>Web Accesibility</strong>. Web accesibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, generally all users have equal access to information and functionality. For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and / or text-to-Braille hardware.</p>
