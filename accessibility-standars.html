	<head><h2><u><strong>¿What are Accesibility Standars?</head></h2></u></strong>
	<p><strong>Accesibility Standars</strong> are a subtopic of the main topic that is <strong>Web Accesibility</strong>. Web accesibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, generally all users have equal access to information and functionality. For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and / or text-to-Braille hardware.</p>

        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium<strong>(W3C)</strong> is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work together to develop web standards. Led by Web inventor and director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to bring the Web to its fullest potential.</p>
        <p><strong>W3C</strong> standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.</p>
	<p><strong>W3C</strong> develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize consensus about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, and to earn endorsement by W3C and the broader community.</p>
