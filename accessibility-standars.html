	<head><h2><u><strong>¿What are Accesibility Standars?</head></h2></u></strong>
	<p><strong>Accesibility Standars</strong> are a subtopic of the main topic that is <strong>Web Accesibility</strong>. Web accesibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, generally all users have equal access to information and functionality. For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and / or text-to-Braille hardware.</p>

        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium<strong>(W3C)</strong> is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work together to develop web standards. Led by Web inventor and director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to bring the Web to its fullest potential.</p>
        <p><strong>W3C</strong> standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.</p>
	<p><strong>W3C</strong> develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize consensus about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, and to earn endorsement by W3C and the broader community.</p>

	<head><h2><u>¿What is WAI?</u></h2></head>
	<p>The World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) commitment to lead the web to its full potential includes promoting a high degree of usability for people with disabilities. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an initiative of the W3C.</p>
	<p>WAI develops its work through W3C’s consensus-based process, involving different stakeholders in web accessibility. These include industry, disability organizations, government, accessibility research organizations, and more.</p>
	<p>WAI, in partnership with organizations around the world, pursues accessibility of the web through these primary activities:
        <p><ul>
	     <li>ensuring that W3C standards support accessibility</li>
	     <li>developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and authoring tools</li>
             <li>developing resources to improve web accessibility evaluation processes and tools</li>
	     <li>supporting education and outreach on web accessibility</li>
	     <li>coordinating with research and development that may impact future accessibility of the web</li>
	     <li>promoting harmonized international uptake of web accessibility standards</li>
	</p></ul>

     <p><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong> (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.</p>
     <p>WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.</p>
     <p>WCAG 2.1 extends Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [WCAG20], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. While WCAG 2.0 remains a W3C Recommendation, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating Web accessibility policies.</p>
